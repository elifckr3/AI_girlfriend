## Project Architecture Overview
Work in Progress Technical Architecture: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1PInWfbWBY9571Hq4R0nf5Uj01agy6YVXV2UTBonUc4A/edit

<b>The Heart of OpenHome:</b> A Dynamic, Ever-Evolving Core At the core of OpenHome is a unique and powerful loop that continuously evolves the personality of your smart speaker. This isn't just about responding to commands; it's about creating an experience that's deeply personal and constantly refreshing. Every interaction with OpenHome is a step towards a more nuanced and tailored experience.

<b>How It Works:</b> The Magic Behind the Scenes Dynamic Personality: OpenHome begins with a foundation of diverse personalities, each ready to provide a distinct interaction experience. But here's the twist â€“ these personalities aren't static. They evolve with every conversation, adapting to your preferences, your style, and your world.

<b>Seamless Interactions:</b> Through our advanced audio module, OpenHome listens and understands, converting your spoken words into a digital format that it can process. This is where the conversation begins.

<b>Smart Processing:</b> Leveraging the power of OpenAI's GPT model, OpenHome intelligently processes your input. Whether it's a command, a query, or casual chatter, the system is designed to understand and respond in the most relevant way.

<b>Personalized Responses:</b> The heart of OpenHome beats in its ability to learn from each interaction. Using our DynamicPersonalityConstructor, the system crafts responses that aren't just accurate but also personalized, taking into account your history and preferences.

<b>Audible Magic:</b> What good is a smart response if it can't be enjoyed? Our text-to-speech module brings the conversation to life, turning text responses into natural, fluent speech.
