<h2>Project Architecture Overview</h2>

<b>The Heart of OpenHome: A Dynamic, Ever-Evolving Core</b>
At the core of OpenHome is a unique and powerful loop that continuously evolves the personality of your smart speaker. This isn't just about responding to commands; it's about creating an experience that's deeply personal and constantly refreshing. Every interaction with OpenHome is a step towards a more nuanced and tailored experience.

<b>How It Works:</b> The Magic Behind the Scenes
Dynamic Personality: OpenHome begins with a foundation of diverse personalities, each ready to provide a distinct interaction experience. But here's the twist â€“ these personalities aren't static. They evolve with every conversation, adapting to your preferences, your style, and your world.

<b>Seamless Interactions:</b> Through our advanced audio module, OpenHome listens and understands, converting your spoken words into a digital format that it can process. This is where the conversation begins.

<b>Smart Processing:</b> Leveraging the power of OpenAI's GPT model, OpenHome intelligently processes your input. Whether it's a command, a query, or casual chatter, the system is designed to understand and respond in the most relevant way.

<b>Personalized Responses:</b> The heart of OpenHome beats in its ability to learn from each interaction. Using our DynamicPersonalityConstructor, the system crafts responses that aren't just accurate but also personalized, taking into account your history and preferences.

<b>Audible Magic:</b> What good is a smart response if it can't be enjoyed? Our text-to-speech module brings the conversation to life, turning text responses into natural, fluent speech.

  <li>For more details, visit <a href="https://brew.sh/">brew.sh</a>.</li>
</ul>

<h3><strong>Step 3: Install Dependencies</strong></h3>
<ul>
  <li>Open terminal and install necessary Python libraries using pip3:
    <pre><code>pip3 install sounddevice soundfile numpy openai colorama datetime base64 pydub requests</code></pre>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3><strong>Step 4: Upgrade the OpenAI Library</strong></h3>

<ui></ui>Verify the Package Version: Ensure you have the correct version of the openai package installed. You can check the version by running:</ul> <code>pip show openai </code>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3><strong>Step 5: Update Your API Keys</strong></h3>
<ul>
  <li>Obtain your OpenAI and ElevenLabs API keys.</li>
  <li>This instance is sending data to Recursal for training. The file is currently using a pass through Recursal API key<li>
  <li>Save them in text files within a folder named <code>api-keys</code> at your script's root directory. Name the files <code>openaiapikey2.txt</code> and <code>elabapikey.txt</code>.</li>
</ul>

<h3><strong>Step 6: Prepare Additional Files</strong></h3>
<ul>
  <li>Ensure necessary files such as <code>Activated.txt</code> in the <code>personalities</code> folder as this is the main personality. Other history files <code>user.txt</code> in the <code>history-files</code> folder are present.</li>
