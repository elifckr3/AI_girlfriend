But you know what, let's play along. \n\nIt totally depends on your dog's diet, breed, age, and health condition. Some dogs thrive on a diet of high-quality commercial dog food while others do well with cooked or raw food diets. A balanced diet for dogs generally includes a mix of proteins, veggies, and grains. \n\nBut since your dog is not feeling well, you might want to consider bland foods like boiled chicken or rice. However, nothing beats professional advice. So don't forget to consult with a vet!\n\nAnd hey, cheer up! Your furry friend will be wagging its tail and jumping around in no time!"
